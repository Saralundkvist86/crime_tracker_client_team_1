This was a fullstack team-programming challenge to use a RESTful API to access and use data. The frontend is created in React, tested with Cypress and the backend is bult in

We chose to use [Brottsplats API](https://brottsplatskartan.se/sida/api) to display the latest crimes comitted in Sweden, to view the full reports you have to login.
